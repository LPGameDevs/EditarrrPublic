### Missing Scripts

When this project was recreated I had to remove a bunch of scripts from
other assets.

In order to not have to rewrite everything straight away I created placeholder
scripts that could be referenced elsewhere and maybe do basic functionality
but not as much as the original scripts.

These scripts should be reviewed and replaced as required. They may not be 
needed if functionality will be solved in a different way or they may need
to be moved into another folder and completed.

Ideally there should be no scripts left in this folder by the time we have
an MVP release.

# EditarrrPublic

> A 2d platformer with level editor and easy level sharing tools to improve creative level design skills by getting quick feedback from playtesters and speedrunning leaderboards to increase replayability.

Made with Unity version `2020.3.25f1`


Very simple prototype for now, but will be added to soon.
